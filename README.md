# Send_HTTP_Request

The code that was written in this repository was learned from this YouTube video:

I am learning this in order to learn how to consume my own REST API.


#Read_HTTP_Request
I read the data from the OpenWeatherMap API and print it in JSON readable format.

The data that is read is only for specific cities. The way to change the city can be done by editing the "CITY_ID". To find the city ID, go to this website https://openweathermap.org/find and look up the city you want and change the city accordingly on the code.

Please do not abuse my API key (Only 60 calls a minute). You can make your own API key by creating an account on https://openweathermap.org/

I give credit to this video (https://youtu.be/og5h5ppwXgU) by Adam Gaweda for helping me understand how to retrieve the API.

JARs: I used the gson-2.8.6.jar file in order to make the JSON data readable. This can be downloaded from https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/code/gson/gson/2.8.6/
